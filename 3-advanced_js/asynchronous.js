// Memory heap:
// Where memory is allocated for states

// Memory leak:
// When there is too much unused states in a program

// Call stack:
// where our code is executed

// Stack overflow:
// This is when the call stack get filled up with or without a chance of the 
// stacks popping off

// Single threaded:
// Has one call stacks and call stack is called once at a time

// Synchronous Programming:
// call stack is executed once at a time

// Asynchronous Programming:
// Sends non-javascript functions to the web api

// Web API
// browser built-in APIs executes the functions

// Callback queue
// the results are then 

// Event loop
