// Memory heap:
// Where memory is allocated for states

// Memory leak:
// When there is too much unused states in a program

// Call stack:
// where our code is executed

// Stack overflow:
// This is when the call stack get filled up with or without a chance of the 
// stacks popping off

// Single threaded:
// Has one call stacks and call stack is called once at a time

// Synchronous Programming:
// call stack is executed once at a time

// Asynchronous Programming:
// Allows JavaScript to run web api functions in the background
// while the call stack continues to be executed

// Web API:
// browser built-in APIs recieves asynchronous codes and executes it

// Callback queue:
// the results are then sent to what is called the callback queue

// Event loop:
// This checks if the call stack is empty, and transfer the codes that are in the callback queue to the call stack

// Callbacks:
// This waits for an action before it gets executed

// Promise:
// Same as aynchronous programming but executes any code (not just web apis) in the background
